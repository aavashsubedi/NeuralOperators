# Neural Operators
Curation of resources for understanding Neural Operators.
Here lies a list of papers and noteworthy resources for understanding Neural Operators. This list has been curated solely for self-use and serves as a "TODO" list of things to read and stuff I thought was useful that I can refer back to. 

* PINNS: https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/ (worth a read as it is one of the most influential papers in the field)
* Neural Ordinary Differential Equations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366
  For this paper, I recommend watching the video first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jltgNGt8Lpg&ab_channel=YannicKilcher

Here is a cool GitHub repo that keeps track of advancements in PINNS:  https://github.com/idrl-lab/PINNpapers
Operators:
* Fourier Neural Operators: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895
   This is the meat and potatoes of Neural Operators currently, and many works are extensions of this framework. I recommend watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaS72aHrJKE&ab_channel=YannicKilcher before you start reading the paper.

Here are some other alternative resources for these in case you want a different perspective:
https://zongyi-li.github.io/neural-operator/ (contains links to other stuff that you may want to check out, like applications!)

* Clifford Neural Layers for PDE Modeling: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04934
  This incorporates symmetries and the system's geometry into the mix.
  The paper can be quite heavy, so I recommend watching this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXziLgMIWf8&t=2597s&ab_channel=ValenceLabs
  Additionally, the series of blogs by the author was quite good for motivating Clifford NN: https://davidruhe.github.io/2023/01/05/hypercomplex-nns.html


What now? I recommend going through the tutorials provided by UVA to familiarise yourself with the code and its applications: 
https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. These are excellent resources in themselves if you want an introduction to a range of different topics in modern DL, and I always refer back to them! 

Some other papers I want/am currently reading are:
